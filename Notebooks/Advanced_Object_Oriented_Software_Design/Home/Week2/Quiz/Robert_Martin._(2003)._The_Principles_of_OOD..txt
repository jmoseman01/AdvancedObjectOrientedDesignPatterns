===== Give an example of how the structured programming disipline has effected modern programming languages? =====
* **ODD principles**
	* **programming displines**
		* **structured programming disipline**
--------------------


* We don't use goto statements anymore

===== How has the object oriented programming disipline effected modern programming languages? =====
**ODD principles - programming displines - object oriented programming disipline**
--------------------

* most mainstream languages are class based they don't usually support functions and variables that aren't in a class anymore.

===== What are the problems that arise from poor dependency management (Aspect of OOD)? =====
