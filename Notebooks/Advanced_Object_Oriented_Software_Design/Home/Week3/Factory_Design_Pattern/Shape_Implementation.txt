====== Shape Implementation ======
Created Wednesday 31 May 2017

* procedure
	* created
		* three shapes and an interface shape with a draw method
			* shapes
				* circle
				* square
				* rectangle
			* interface
				* shape interface
		* factory
			* the factory took in a string argument inside a method called get shape to construct a shape
		* A main class
			* this had a main method that constructed the shape based on the shape type parameter string and executed the draw method.
* learning procedure
	* some copy paste
		* the code I copied and pasted I commented then deleted and implemented it myself
	* after I did that I then implmented the whole project from scratch



* Note the interface is important so that the factory's get shape method can construct any three of the shapes
